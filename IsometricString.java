//Approach #1
//We are taking 2 HashMaps and maintain mapping of each character of str1-> str2. Loop over 1st string
//and map each character str1 and str2. Loop over 2nd string and map each character of str2 to str1. 
//If the character is already mapped then check if the mapped character is equal to the current character in another string.
//If yes, then we move ahead otherwise its not isomorphic string . We repeat trhis process while looping over str2.

//TC: O(2N) -> O(N)
//sc: O(2*26) -> O(1)


//Approach #2
//We are using HashMap and HastSet, We check in Str1 is mapped to current character in  str2 and is present in HashMap.
//Check if character that current character in str1 in mapped is equal to str2's current charater, if not then its not isomorphic.
//If its not present in HashMap.Check if its present in HashSet which means the character is already mapped to something that would mean its not isomorphic . Otherwise add the character to HashMap & HashSet.
